# PointAndClickGame
 The core mechanics for a point and click game, not yet a full game concept. The art is just placeholder art, so it's mostly cubes and rough UI. Once the core features have been developed, I'll make a proper prototype with actual art (probably from asset stores and not made by me as art isn't an area I'm skilled in).

You can view a demo of the game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZYher-kOWI).
